# 1_Analyze-and-Experimental-verification-of-Kirchhoff-s-laws

### **Aim**  
To verify Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law by measuring the voltages across each resistor in a closed loop and proving that the algebraic sum of voltages is zero.

---

### **Objectives**
- To apply KVL in a closed electrical loop.  
- To measure voltage across each resistor.  
- To compare theoretical and practical values.  
- To understand the real-time application of Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law.

---

### **Procedure**
1. Make circuit connections by dragging nodes in the simulation.
2. Connect power supply (1–9, 2–10).
3. Connect voltmeters across the resistors.  
4. Click **CHECK** to validate connections.
5. Set R1, R2, R3 values.
6. Turn **Power ON**.
7. Adjust voltage slider and observe voltmeter readings.
8. Click **ADD** to store readings.
9. Take **minimum 6 readings**.
10. Click **PLOT** to generate the graph.
11. Use **PRINT** if needed.
12. Click **RESET** to restart the simulation.
